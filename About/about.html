        <!-- Some facts about it -->
        208 million years ago, from the ocean below, a colorful force with the
        strength of a thousand rainbows pierced the surface, cracked Pangea’s
        supercontinent, and altered the atmospheric levels of fruity juiciness
        on planet Earth forever
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="additional-paragraph">
      From this geyser sprayed forth an endless rain of SKITTLES in Lemon,
      Strawberry, Grape, Orange, and one flavor too notorious to name. SKITTLES
      covered the land far and wide, high and low, as far as the eye could see.
      Every dinosaur was full and happy, and spent their days creating art and
      writing terrible love songs

    <!-- How the company starts -->
    <div class="h4">
      <h4>BEGINNING</h4>
      <p class="para2">
        Skittles were first made commercially in 1974 by a British company. An
        animated television advertisement from that year bears the logo of the
        "Galaxy" company and is copyrighted by Jack Candies Ltd, a Mars
        distribution subsidiary.They were first introduced in North America in
        1979 as an import confectionery.In 1982, domestic production of Skittles
        began in the United States.The name of the candy, Skittles, comes from
        the sports game of the same name, named as such for the resemblance of
        the sweet to items used in the game.Skittles' "taste the rainbow" theme
        was created by the New York ad agency D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles.On
        March 2, 2009, Skittles launched a web-based marketing campaign where
        the official website became a small overlay with options to view
        different social media sites in the main area, including its official
        YouTube channel, a Facebook profile, and a Twitter account. The move was
        debated by people interested in social media. In 2009, the production of
        Skittles ceased using animal-derived gelatin, making them suitable for
        vegetarians, vegans, and certain religious groups.
